	 When we observe, we realize there is a separation after every 4 bits, such that the first 4 bits are called EXTI0, the next 4 bits are called EXTI1, EXTI2, EXTI3. In the truth table, it tells us how to connect the various ports to the EXTI line.For eg, it says if you want any of the exti-lines to be connected to port A PA, you have to pass 0000 in all 4 bits.
	 So if we want EXTI line 2 to be connected to port A, then we have to set bit 8 to 0, bit 9 to 0, bit 10 to 0, and bit 11 to 0. If we want exti-line 1 to be connected to port C, we have to set bit 4 to 0, bit 5 to 1, bit 6 to 0, and bit 7 to 0.If this register didn't have everything set to 0, we would need to clear the bits we want to use before we configure them.
	 But because it's all 0000 that is why we're not clearing any of the bits, because they are all 0 by default.We need to set 1 at the positions we want to set in order to get the perfect arrangement for the port.We are interested in , we have to access the configuration register 4. We want to connect  to PC13 to port C.The first bit has to be 0, the second bit has to be 1.
