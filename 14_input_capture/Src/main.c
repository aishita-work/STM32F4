/*remember PA5 is configured in output compare mode such that the pin is toggled every second. So this is generating a sort of square wave that goes, every second it goes up
and then another second it comes down.This is going to be out source or signal source and we're going to capture this at PA6.
 Set up- Connect a jumper wire from PA5 to PA6. After uploading the code to stm32 board , add timestamp global variable to live expressions, press enter and press to run.
 We can see the led toggle and capture value.*/
