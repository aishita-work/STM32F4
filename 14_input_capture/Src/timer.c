 But this time, the toggle rate that we generated at PA5, we want to capture it using another timer pin.So we will connect PA5
 to a separate time channel to be able to read the rate at which it is toggling.We'll capture PA5 using out timer 3.*/

So we can configure PA6 to be acting as timer three channel one over here, such that we can connect the input whose toggle rate we want
to capture at PA6.*/
